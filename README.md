## Overview
This project is aimed at performing sentiment analysis on text data, classifying it as either positive or negative. Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves determining the sentiment or emotion expressed in a piece of text. This README provides an overview of the project, including its objectives, features, usage, and installation instructions.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to develop a sentiment analysis model capable of accurately classifying text data as positive or negative. The model can be used to analyze customer feedback, social media posts, product reviews, and other forms of text data to gain insights into user sentiment.

## Features
- Preprocessing: Text preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, lemmatization, and stop word removal are applied to clean and normalize the text data.
- Machine Learning Model: A machine learning model, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) or Naive Bayes, is trained on labeled text data to perform sentiment classification.
- Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Deployment: The trained model can be deployed as a web service or integrated into other applications for real-time sentiment analysis.
